    <h2>   Mohamed Lahbabi is a first-year preparatory student in the engineering program at EPITA. He has been playing video games since childhood, and this motivates him to thrive in a field of study that teaches him how the games that have shaped his journey were made from a technical point of view. He chose to focus on computer science to complement the artistic skills he has already developed. Passionate about everything related to creation, whether the field concerned is more oriented towards art or computer science, he is motivated to succeed in what he loves and to find his place in the industry that led him to be where he is today. When it comes to conceptualizing the world of a potential video game, whether on the visual or audio aspect, he is already familiar with the steps necessary to ensure success in this part of development. Mohamed draws at a high level on digital software, such as Clip Studio Paint, and makes music on FL Studio for the sound arrangement that will be used in the game's universe.
